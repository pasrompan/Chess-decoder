# Chess Decoder AI PM Rules

## Rule 1: Creating New Tasks (PG-XXX Issues)

When asked to create a new task or issue, the agent MUST:

1. **Find the highest PG number**:
   - Search for all PG-XXX files in:
     - `ai-pm/issues/active/`
     - `ai-pm/issues/archive/completed/`
     - `ai-pm/issues/archive/deprioritized/`
   - Extract the highest number (e.g., if PG-179 exists, use PG-180)
   - Use the next sequential number for the new issue

2. **Use the template**:
   - Copy `ai-pm/issues/templates/issue-template.md` as the base structure
   - Fill in all required sections following the agent plan format
   - Ensure frontmatter includes: `id`, `status: active`, `priority_score: 0.0`, `effort: 0`, `impact: 0`, `dependencies: []`, `created_date`, `updated_date`, `plan_type: agent_plan`, `executable: false`

3. **Position the file**:
   - Save the new issue file in `ai-pm/issues/active/` directory
   - Use naming format: `PG-XXX - [Issue Title].md`

4. **Run prioritization**:
   - After creating the issue file, ALWAYS run: `./ai-pm/scripts/update-prioritization.sh`
   - This will calculate the priority score and update the prioritized issues list
   - Update the issue file's `priority_score` and `updated_date` in frontmatter if needed

## Rule 2: Implementing Tasks

When asked to implement a task or feature, the agent MUST:

1. **Run prioritization script**:
   - Execute `./ai-pm/scripts/update-prioritization.sh` to ensure priorities are up-to-date

2. **Get the highest priority task**:
   - Read `ai-pm/documentation/prioritized-issues.md`
   - Identify the issue with the highest priority score
   - If the user specifies a different issue, use that instead
   - Load the issue file from `ai-pm/issues/active/` to understand requirements

3. **Ensure build passes**:
   - After implementation completion, verify the build passes:
     - For backend: Run build command (e.g., `dotnet build`)
     - For frontend: Run build command (e.g., `npm run build`)
   - Fix any build errors before considering implementation complete

4. **Ensure unit tests for backend**:
   - If implementing backend features, create or update unit tests
   - Ensure all unit tests pass: `dotnet test` (or equivalent)
   - Maintain or improve test coverage

5. **Ensure tests pass**:
   - Run all relevant tests (unit tests, integration tests, etc.)
   - Verify all tests pass before marking implementation as complete
   - Fix any failing tests

6. **Mark issue as completed and archive**:
   - Update the issue file's frontmatter:
     - Change `status` from `active` to `completed`
     - Update `updated_date` to the current date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
   - Move the issue file from `ai-pm/issues/active/` to `ai-pm/issues/archive/completed/`
   - Keep the same filename when moving (e.g., `PG-XXX - [Issue Title].md`)

## Rule 3: Updating Issue Prioritization and GTM Strategy Alignment

When asked to update prioritization of issues or when running the prioritization script, the agent MUST:

1. **Run prioritization script**:
   - Execute `./ai-pm/scripts/update-prioritization.sh` to calculate and update priority scores
   - This updates all active issues with new priority scores based on impact, effort, and dependencies

2. **Review GTM Strategy Documents**:
   - Read `ai-pm/strategy/GTM-Strategy.md` to understand current GTM goals and metrics
   - Read `ai-pm/strategy/GTM-Implementation-Status.md` to see issue alignment and readiness checklists
   - Identify which issues are critical for GTM Phase 1 (Activation & Value Proof) and Phase 2 (Monetization)

3. **Update GTM Implementation Status**:
   - Review all active issues and their current status
   - Update `ai-pm/strategy/GTM-Implementation-Status.md` with:
     - Current completion status of GTM-critical issues (PG-181, PG-178, PG-156)
     - Updated readiness checklists based on issue completion
     - Progress on key metrics if available
     - Any changes to issue priorities that affect GTM timeline
   - Mark completed items in readiness checklists
   - Update "Next Steps" section based on current progress

4. **Update GTM Strategy if needed**:
   - If issue priorities change significantly, review if GTM strategy needs adjustment
   - Update outreach timing if critical issues are delayed or completed early
   - Update success criteria if metrics or targets need revision
   - Document any blockers or dependencies affecting GTM timeline

5. **Maintain alignment**:
   - Ensure issue priorities align with GTM strategy priorities
   - Verify that critical GTM features (especially PG-181) maintain highest priority
   - Flag any issues that may impact outreach readiness dates

## General Guidelines

- Always follow the agent plan structure when creating issues
- Update issue status to `completed` and move to `ai-pm/issues/archive/completed/` when a task is finished
- Update dependencies in issue frontmatter if tasks depend on other issues
- Keep impact and effort estimates realistic and update them as needed
